# CB Website Gatsby

A simple artwork showcase site with a contact form.

It is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) version of the previous [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) site that I built last year(2019).

I started with a basic Gatsby starter site and worked through [Wes Bos'](https://wesbos.com/) recent Gatsby pizza shop course using a [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io/) CMS. I got to re-use a lot from the Next JS site.
